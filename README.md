Returns the 3 structures required to produce a mesh for waterfall plots, wireframes and other contour like visualizations where you have a matrix and need the X,Y&amp;Z vectors from it

If you have a matrix, mm, and want to produce a wireframe plot from it: im2wireframe(mm)

If you have a matrix and want to produce the X,Y,Z components typically required for a mesh, returns these matrices: im2mesh(mm)
